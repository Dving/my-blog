      <p>My name is Den Piaterenkov. All my life is connected with IT. Everything has begun in 1998. My first computer has been made of components. In my city, I was one of the first who had a personal computer. Therefore people asked me for the technical help. Most often I helped to restore operation of the computer. It was sometimes necessary to create the website or to make changes to it. Further, I periodically worked in various organizations in which knowledge of the personal computer, computer networks and the equipment, development, and maintenance of the websites on the Internet was required.
        In each of the applied technologies, I was improved until could do everything unaided. This approach always was for me the main thing.
        At the moment I am engaged in web development. In the near future, I consider myself the developer of a full stack in web development.</p>
